# Implementation
I have spent a total of 4.5 hours on this project.

Although I have gotten the functionality working locally, I am unable to get the deployed version working for some reason.

- Ability to join a default round, with the vote stored in the database
- Ability to undo a vote
- Users are unable to vote once they already have voted
- Database schema supports adding custom rounds (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)
